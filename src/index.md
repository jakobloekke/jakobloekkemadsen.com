# Hi, I'm Jakobâ€“

<div class="greeting">a friendly freelance developer, based in Aarhus, Denmark</div>

I'm passionate about the web as a platform for enhancing focus, meaning and effiency in the world.

Magic happens when **_UX, design and technology_** are fused.\
I have many years of experience making that happen.<sup>\*</sup>

<div class="header__defluff">
  <em><sup>*</sup>"Wow, that's fluffy ... what is it that you do, exactly?"</em>

Since putting my first website online in 1999 (thanks, Dreamweaver), I have been a web designer, "seo expert", UX/interaction designer, consultant, frontend developer, mobile developer, full stack developer and startup founder.

I've seen the web evolve from a place for personal PHP websites, through enterprise CMS sites in Sharepoint and Sitecore and into a mature platform for business critical applications.

Today, I specialize in creating modern web applications that bring focus and clarity in our busy world of big data, IOT and machine learning.

I'm equally at home in frameworks such as **_Angular, React and Vue_**.

Every day, I learn something new, both technically and otherwise.\
 I have come to know deeply, that great results come from inspired teams that work well together. It's never a solo effort. That's why I care a lot about agile processes and always strive to be open-minded and easy to work with.
