# Hi, I'm Jakobâ€“
<div class="greeting">a friendly freelance web developer, based in Aarhus, Denmark</div>

Magic happens when ***UX, design and technology*** are fused.\
And I have many years of experience in making that happen.

I'm passionate about the web as a platform for bringing focus, meaning and effiency to the world.*

<div class="header__defluff">
  * <em>"What a load of fluff ... Could you just tell me what you do, please?"</em>

  Well, since putting my first website online in 1999 (thanks, Adobe Golive), I have worn many hats: Web designer, UX/IA designer, consultant, frontend developer, full stack developer.

  I've seen the web evolve from a place for personal PHP websites, through huge enterprise CMS sites in Sharepoint and Sitecore and into a platform for applications and interactive data visualizations in a world of big data, IOT and machine learning.

  Today, I specialize in creating modern web applications.\
  I'm equally at home in frameworks such as ***Angular, React and Vue***.
