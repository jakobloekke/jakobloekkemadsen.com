# Hi, I'm Jakobâ€“
<div class="greeting">a friendly freelance developer, based in Aarhus, Denmark</div>

I'm passionate about the web as a platform for enhancing focus, meaning and effiency in the world.

Magic happens when ***UX, design and technology*** are fused.\
I have many years of experience making that happen.

  <em>"Ok, that's fluffy ... what is it that you do, again?"</em>

  Well thanks for asking!\
  Since putting my first website online in 1999 (thanks, Dreamweaver), I have been a web designer, seo expert, UX/interaction designer, consultant, frontend developer, mobile developer, full stack developer and startup founder.

  I've seen the web evolve from a place for personal PHP websites, through huge enterprise CMS sites in Sharepoint and Sitecore and into a mature platform for business critical applications.

  Today, I specialize in creating modern web applications that bring focus and clarity in our busy world of big data, IOT and machine learning.

  I'm equally at home in frameworks such as ***Angular, React and Vue***.
